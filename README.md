# Console Checkers

A console-based Checkers game written in Python, featuring a MinMax AI opponent with Alpha-Beta pruning and box-drawing character rendering.

## Features

- **Console Rendering**: Uses Unicode box-drawing characters for a clean board display.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Highlights the last move made (start and end squares) for better visibility.
- **Efficient Updates**: Uses `bext` to update only changed parts of the board, preventing flickering.
- **Game Modes**: Choose between Player vs Player or Player vs AI.
- **Advanced AI**: Uses Iterative Deepening, Move Ordering, and a sophisticated Evaluation Function (Position, Safety, Structure) for strong gameplay.
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time display of remaining pieces for both players.
- **Input Handling**: Intuitive algebraic notation (e.g., "C3 D4").
- **Benchmarking Suite**: Includes tools to simulate games and analyze AI performance.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: For running the analysis notebook, you will also need `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `jupyter`.*

## How to Play

Run the game using:
```bash
python main.py
```

1.  Select your game mode from the welcome screen.
2.  **RED** starts at the bottom, **BLACK** starts at the top.
3.  Enter moves in the format `Start End` (e.g., `C3 D4`).
4.  Press `q` to quit.

## Project Structure

- `board.py`: Board representation, rendering logic, and move validation.
- `ai.py`: Production AI implementation (Iterative Deepening).
- `input_handler.py`: User input parsing.
- `constants.py`: Game constants and configuration.
- `testing/`: Directory containing benchmarking tools and analysis notebooks.
- `docs/`: Sphinx documentation source files.

## AI Implementation

The AI has been upgraded from a basic MinMax algorithm to a more robust engine featuring:

1.  **Iterative Deepening**: The AI searches deeper and deeper (Depth 1, 2, 3...) within a fixed time limit (default 1.0s), ensuring it always returns the best move found so far without hanging.
2.  **Move Ordering**: Captures and promotions are evaluated first, allowing Alpha-Beta pruning to cut off bad branches significantly earlier.
3.  **Enhanced Evaluation Function**:
    -   **Material**: Base value of pieces and Kings.
    -   **Positioning**: Rewards controlling the center.
    -   **Safety**: Penalizes pieces vulnerable to capture.
4.  **Non-Deterministic Play**: Randomizes selection among equally good moves to provide a more varied and human-like opponent.
    -   **Structure**: Rewards keeping pieces connected (defending each other).

## Testing & Benchmarking

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite to validate AI improvements.

### Running Benchmarks
To simulate games between the Old AI (Baseline) and the New AI:

```bash
python testing/benchmark.py
```
This will run 100 games (50 with New AI as Red, 50 as Black) and save the results to `benchmark_results.json`.

### Analyzing Results
Open `testing/analysis.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Lab to view detailed statistics, including:
- Win Rates
- Move Time Distribution
- Game Length Analysis
- Phase Comparison (First vs Second player advantage)

See `testing/TESTING.md` for more details on the methodology.
